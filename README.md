# Basic Authentication using Express and Typescript

Do you use express for your backend and curious about building a basic auth using express and typescript or exploring to adapt typescript for your application backend. you're in the right place. I often see tutorials throwing me lot of jargons and concepts while i am trying to learn typescript for rest api design and build a basic auth. i agree that we need it. but, most of them are opinionated and can be simplified when starting out.

## To Run the Application

```
npm i
npm run dev
```
